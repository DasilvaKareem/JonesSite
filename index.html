                        <p>With over a decade of experience as an educator within Memphis-Shelby County Schools, I have dedicated my career to supporting students and teachers across our district.</p>
                        <p>As both a teacher and substitute, I've had the unique opportunity to step inside classrooms across multiple schools, listen to educators, support students, and see firsthand what is working and where support is needed.</p>
                        <p>My commitment to this district is both professional and personal—as an educator, a parent, and a grandparent with children currently enrolled in MSCS.</p>

                <h2>Why I'm Running</h2>
                <div class="why-content">
                    <p class="lead">I am running because every child deserves to be seen, supported, and challenged—no exceptions.</p>

                    <p>As an educator within Memphis-Shelby County Schools for more than a decade, I have seen the gaps that exist between schools, programs, and resources—and I believe those gaps can and must be closed. I have served the district as both a teacher and a substitute, which allowed me to step inside classrooms across multiple schools, listen to educators, support students, and see firsthand what is working and where support is needed.</p>

                    <p>My commitment to this district is both professional and personal. I have had a former student graduate from the Shelby County School system, and today, my grandchildren are enrolled in Memphis-Shelby County Schools. I understand this system not only as an educator, but as a parent and grandparent who wants the very best for our children.</p>

                    <p>Students with IEPs deserve strong support and dignity in learning. Students in AP and advanced classes deserve continued investment and opportunity. And every child in between deserves consistency, fairness, and high expectations—delivered by supported teachers and strengthened through meaningful family engagement.</p>

                    <p>My commitment goes beyond District 5. I am running to advocate for policies and decisions that benefit all students across the Memphis-Shelby County School District by supporting educators, partnering with parents and families, and ensuring schools have the tools they need. Because when we put children first—every child, every school, every day—our entire community benefits.</p>
